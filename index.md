### New Unit Introduction: Cause-Effect Essay
For the third Major Assignment, you will write an essay of around 500 words to explore the **causes and effects** of a particular event, situation, or phenomenon.
#### What Is a Cause-Effect Essay? (adapted from National Geographic Learning)
We all understand cause-effect relationships; for example, lightning can cause fire. As a student you know that if you stay up late the night before a test to watch a movie and do not study, you may not perform well on the test the following day. A cause-effect essay tells how one event (the cause) leads to another event (the effect).
  
A cause-effect essay can do one of two things:  
- It can analyze the ways in which one or more effects result from a particular cause. (Focus-on-Effects Method)
- It can analyze the ways in which one or more causes lead to a particular effect. (Focus-on-Causes Method)
  
### Activity: Evaluating Causes/Effects
See PowerPoint slides in class
### Activity: Mapping Cause-Effect Relationships 
- Map
  - Get into groups of 3 to 4 people
  - Read the argument
  - Identify the causes and effects in this argument
  - Together, discuss the logical cause-effect relationships in this argument
  - Together, draw a map of the argument
- Present
  - One group member will come up to draw the map/diagram and explain the logical relationships

**Map this argument:**  
① In surveys Mason City residents rank water sports (swimming, boating, and fishing) among their favorite recreational activities. ② The Mason River flowing through the city is rarely used for these pursuits, however, and ③ the city park department devotes little of its budget to maintaining riverside recreational facilities. ④ For years there have been complaints from residents about the quality of the river’s water and the river’s smell. ⑤ In response, the state has recently announced plans to clean up Mason River. ⑥ Use of the river for water sports is, therefore, sure to increase. ⑦ The city government should for that reason devote more money in this year’s budget to riverside recreational facilities.

### Using cross tabulation to brainstorm points of comparison

#### Step 1: Choose Your Comparison Categories
Start by identifying the categories you want to compare and contrast between your two subjects. These categories will depend on the nature of your subjects. For example, if you're comparing two novels, categories might include themes, characters, plot, and setting.

#### Step 2: Create a Cross Tabulation Table
Draw a table with two columns and several rows. At the top of each column, write the name of one of the subjects you are comparing. Then, along the left side of the table, list your comparison categories in the rows.

#### Step 3: Fill in the Table
Now, for each category (row), fill in the corresponding cells with key points, ideas, or features from each subject. This step helps you systematically break down the similarities and differences between the subjects based on each category.

#### Example:
If you're comparing two historical figures, your table might look like this:

| **Category** | **Person 1** | **Person 2** |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Early Life   | Born in... | Born in... |
| Achievements | Won Nobel Prize | Discovered... |
| Challenges   | Faced opposition... | Struggled with... |
| Legacy       | Remembered for... | Known for... |

If you're comparing two different forms of government: Democracy and Monarchy:

| **Category**        | **Democracy**                                                  | **Monarchy**                                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | A system of government where power is vested in the people, who rule either directly or through freely elected representatives. | A form of government with a monarch at the head, where power is typically inherited. |
| **Power Structure** | Power is distributed among various branches of government and elected officials. | Power is centralized under a single individual, such as a king or queen. |
| **Citizen Role**    | Citizens have a direct role in electing leaders and making decisions through voting. | Citizens typically have limited or no role in the selection of leaders or decision-making processes. |
| **Advantages**      | Promotes equality and freedom; encourages participation and accountability. | Stability and continuity of leadership; can be more efficient in decision-making. |
| **Disadvantages**   | Can lead to gridlock and inefficiency; risk of majority rule suppressing minority rights. | Risk of autocratic rule; less accountability and potential for abuse of power. |
| **Examples**        | United States, India, Germany | United Kingdom (constitutional monarchy), Saudi Arabia (absolute monarchy) |

#### Step 4: Identify Points of Comparison
After filling out the table, look for patterns, trends, or interesting contrasts in the information you've collected. These will form the basis of your comparison points in the essay.

### Structure of Comparison & Contrast Essay: Block Organization or Point-by-Point Organization

#### Block Organization (Subject-by-Subject)
In this structure, you discuss all the relevant points for one subject first, then move on to the second subject. This approach works well when comparing two subjects that are distinctly different or when you want your reader to understand one subject completely before introducing the second.

**Format:**
1. Introduction
2. All points related to Subject A
3. Transition paragraph (optional)
4. All points related to Subject B
5. Conclusion

#### Point-by-Point Organization (Feature-by-Feature)
This structure involves discussing a point of comparison or contrast between your subjects in each paragraph. It allows for a more integrated comparison and is effective when you want to emphasize the relationships between the points being compared across the subjects.

**Format:**
1. Introduction
2. Point 1: Comparison/Contrast of Subject A and B
3. Point 2: Comparison/Contrast of Subject A and B
4. Additional points
5. Conclusion

#### Deciding Which Structure to Use

##### Consider Your Subjects
- **Similarity:** If your subjects are very similar, Point-by-Point allows you to highlight subtle differences more effectively.
- **Complexity:** For subjects that are complex and require detailed explanation, Block Organization might be better to avoid confusing your reader.

##### Think About Your Points of Comparison
- **Number of Points:** If you have many small points of comparison, Point-by-Point can keep your essay organized and focused. If you have fewer, broader points, Block Organization might work better.
- **Relationships Between Points:** If the points of comparison are closely related or influence each other, Point-by-Point helps illustrate these relationships. If they're more independent, Block might be simpler.

### Comparison and contrast: Advanced level!
#### Compare and constrast two genres of writing
The following are two articles presenting the same study on smartphone addiction. The first article is published on the *Daily Mail UK*, a British tabloid. The second article is published in *Computers in Human Behavior*, an academic journal.
- Article on *Daily Mail*: [The countries with the highest rates of SMARTPHONE ADDICTION revealed - with China, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia topping the list](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-10498963/The-countries-highest-rates-SMARTPHONE-ADDICTION-revealed.html) *(The website will ask you for notification permission. Do not click "allow" if you don't intend to.)*  
- Article on *Computers in Human Behavior*: [Smartphone addiction is increasing across the world: A meta-analysis of 24 countries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563221004611)
  
##### Activity 1: Audience Perspective Role Play
- Step 1: Get into pairs. Student A will read the tabloid article and Student B will read the academic journal article.
- Step 2: You will summarize to each other your takeaways from the article you read. Compare your takeaways.
  
##### Activity 2: Analyze the Articles
- Step 1: In your same group, this time, Student B will read the tabloid article and Student A will read the academic journal article.
- Step 2: Now that you've all read both articles, discuss why you think you had different takeaways from these two articles (how different presentations can lead to varied understandings).
- Step 3: Suppose you are writing an essay and conpare and constrast these two articles, what would your thesis statement be? In your same group, come up with a thesis statement together.

### Today's Activity: A Comparison and Contrast Debate!
An essay written by American columnist and reporter Michael Hiltzik published in *LA Times* in 2016 argued against the idea that video is a superior form of media consumption compared to text:  
- [Don’t believe Facebook: The demise of the written word is very far off](https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-written-word-demise-20160617-snap-story.html)
  
Unsurprisingly, this topic is still very, if not more, relevant today.  
  
#### Debate Activity: "The Future of Communication: Text vs. Video"
Will the written word remain a dominant form of communication, or will video take over?
  
##### Objective:
You will engage in a structured debate to explore and articulate complex arguments regarding the future dominance of text or video in communication, as discussed in Michael Hiltzik's article.
  
##### Activity Breakdown:
  
**1. Preparation**
- **Reading:** Take 10 minute to read Michael Hiltzik's article and get familiar with the context.
- **Divide the Class:** The class will split into two groups. One group will argue for the continued dominance of the written word, and the other will argue for the increasing dominance of video.
- **Preparation Time:** Each group will have 10 minutes to prepare their arguments. You are encouraged to use specific points from the article and to think about counterarguments to the opposing side's potential points.
  
**2. Opening Statements**
- Each group presents their opening statement, summarizing their position. Each group will have 2 minutes.
  
**3. Argument Rounds**
- **Round 1:** Each group takes turns presenting their main arguments. Each speaker have no more than 2 minutes. When one group speaks, the other group should take notes and think about how to counter-argue.
- **Round 2:** Rebuttal round. Groups respond to the arguments made by the opposing side. You are encouraged to address specific points and to use evidence from the article and external sources.
  
**4. Closing Statements**
- Each group has 2 minutes to make their final case, summarizing their key points and rebuttals.

### Intro to 2nd Essay: Compare and Contrast
A comparison and contrast essay examines two or more subjects by comparing their similarities and contrasting their differences. This type of essay typically structures information either by subject (discussing all aspects of one subject before moving to the next) or by point (alternating between subjects for each point of comparison or contrast). Its purpose is to analyze the subjects in relation to each other to highlight how they are alike or distinct, often to make a larger point about the subjects' characteristics or implications.  

### Compare and Contrast Discussion
#### Discussion topic: "Talent" in different cultures
1. **Nature of Talent**: How do your culture's beliefs about whether talent is innate or developed compare with what you've observed or heard about other cultures? 
2. **Importance of Talent vs. Effort**: In your home country, which is more valued in professions like arts, academics, or sports: natural talent or hard work? How does this stand in contrast to other countries or cultures you're aware of?
3. **Recognition and Rewards**: Compare the ways societies reward natural talent versus perseverance. Is there a difference between your home culture and others in terms of which is rewarded more?
4. **Education and Talent**: In the education system you grew up in, how are "talented" students treated compared to those in other countries or cultures you're familiar with? Are there unique programs or systems in place?
5. **Pressure and Expectations**: Compare the pressures of being labeled as "talented" in your home country to what you perceive those pressures to be in other cultures or countries.
6. **Overlooked Abilities**: Are there certain skills or abilities that are more valued in your culture compared to others? Conversely, are there talents that you feel are undervalued in your culture but celebrated elsewhere?
7. **Role of Opportunity**: How do opportunities and resources available for nurturing talent in your home country compare to another country or culture you're familiar with?
8. **Cultural Narratives**: Think of cultural heroes from your country celebrated for their talents. How do their stories of innate ability or perseverance compare with similar figures from another culture?
9. **Talent in the Workplace**: Compare how employers in your country prioritize talent versus experience or qualifications with what you know of practices in other countries.
10. **Talent in Changing Times**: How do you think the importance placed on certain talents in your home country compares to another when considering technological and societal changes?

### Crafting Your Response

#### Objective:
Today's class is dedicated to developing the response portion of your summary-response essay. Through the activities and discussions, you'll refine your ability to articulate a compelling, evidence-backed viewpoint on your chosen article.

#### Agenda:

**Warm-Up: Quick Reflection**
   - Write down one key argument from your article that you strongly agree or disagree with. Think about why this argument stood out to you.

**Group Discussion: Sharing Insights**
   - Form small groups and share the argument you chose during the warm-up. Discuss your initial thoughts on agreeing or disagreeing with the author's viewpoint.

**Introduction to Response Strategies**

>##### Strategy 1: Agreeing with a Twist
>- **Description:** You agree with the article’s points but introduce a new angle or insight that wasn't covered.
>- **Approach:** Start by acknowledging the points you agree with, then introduce your unique perspective or additional evidence that builds on the original argument.
>
>##### Strategy 2: Disagreeing with Reasons
>- **Description:** You challenge the article’s arguments, offering evidence or reasoning to support your disagreement.
>- **Approach:** Clearly state which points you disagree with and why. Use evidence from the article, other sources, or personal experience to back up your counter-argument.
>
>##### Strategy 3: Reflecting on Personal Experience
>- **Description:** You connect the article’s themes or arguments to your own experiences, adding depth and personal insight.
>- **Approach:** Share a personal story or reflection that relates to the article. Explain how your experience supports, contradicts, or sheds new light on the article's points.
>
>##### Strategy 4: Analyzing the Implications
>- **Description:** You explore the broader implications or consequences of the article’s arguments.
>- **Approach:** Discuss the potential impact of the article’s ideas on society, a particular group, or the future. Consider both positive and negative outcomes.
>
>##### Tips for Writing Your Response:
>1. **Be Specific:** Focus on particular points or arguments from the article. Avoid generalizations.
>2. **Use Evidence:** Support your response with evidence, whether from the article, external sources, or personal experience.
>3. **Stay Objective:** While personal opinions are valuable, ensure your response is grounded in logical reasoning and evidence.
>4. **Employ Signal Verbs:** Use verbs that accurately reflect the author’s stance (e.g., argues, claims, suggests) and verbs that articulate your response (e.g., contend, oppose, affirm).
>5. **Maintain Clarity:** Be clear and concise in your writing. Ensure your reader understands the article's points you're responding to and your stance on them.
  
**Activity: Strategy Application**
   - In your groups, select one strategy from the handout to focus on. Using this strategy, brainstorm potential responses to the argument discussed earlier. Consider how different perspectives or new evidence could enrich your response.

**Debate: Exploring Multiple Sides**
   - Each group presents their response ideas to the class, initiating a mini-debate. Encourage respectful challenge and support for the ideas presented, exploring the argument from multiple angles.

### How to Cite Properly (MLA)
#### Example
**Original text:**  
"Feral cats roamed far more widely than researchers had expected: up to 1,351 acres. In contrast, pet cats stayed within an average of about five acres of home."  
  
**Author:** Madhumita Venkataramanan  
**Title of article:** "Where House Cats Roam"  
**Title of journal:** *Scientific American*  
**Year of publication:** 2011  
**Page number:** 30  

#### Citing as a Direct Quote
*In her article “Where House Cats Roam”, Madhumita Venkataramanan references a study that found that “pet cats stayed within an average of about five acres of home” (30).*  

#### Citing as a Paraphrase
*When pet cats go outdoors, they stay relatively close to home, whereas their feral counterparts sometimes roam over a thousand acres (Venkatraman 30).*  
 - (in APA the page number would be the publication year)

### Using Signal Phrases
**Definition:** Signal phrases are short phrases that introduce a quote, paraphrase, or summary; they signal to readers that an outside source is being used.  

#### Function of signal phrases: Avoid plagiarism and ambiguity

**Example**  
"In the personal realm, most Americans are thoughtful, caring, generous. We try to do our best by family and friends. At times we'll even stop to help another driver stranded with a roadside breakdown, or give some spare change to a stranger. [...] We've all but forgotten that public participation is the very soul of democratic citizenship, and how much it can enrich our lives." (excerpt from *Soul of a Citizen* by Paul Loeb)

**Paraphrase draft #1:**  
"Most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy. We tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good. We don't realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - What is the problem?  

**Paraphrase draft #2:**  
"According to Paul Loeb, most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy. We tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good. Paul Loeb thinks that we don't realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - Any problems still? (think in-text citation)  

**Paraphrase draft #3:**  
"According to Paul Loeb, most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy; we tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good (2). Although Loeb doesn't say so explicitly, he suggests that we fail to realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - Any problems still? (No it's perfect!!)  

#### Function of signal phrases: Establish credibility of the source authors

**Example:**  
"In Soul of a Citizen, **journalist and lecturer Paul Loeb** observes that most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but that few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy (2)."

#### Function of signal phrases: Capture the authors’ viewpoint

**Examples:**  
"In Soul of a Citizen, journalist and lecturer Paul Loeb **observes** that most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but that few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy (2)."  
 - accuracy
  
"In *Job Shift*, consultant William Bridges **worries about** “dejobbing and about what a future shaped by it is going to be like.” Even more worrisome, Bridges **argues**, is the possibility that “the sense of craft and of professional vocation . . . will break down under the need to earn a fee” (228)."  
 - a sense of urgency   
  
"In *Job Shift*, William Bridges **unreasonably contends / fantasizes** that “the sense of craft and of professional vocation . . . will break down under the need to earn a fee” (228)."  
 - we don't agree with the author  

#### Some Frequently Used Signal Verbs

<pre>
acknowledges   claims         emphasizes     remarks  
admits         concludes      expresses      replies  
advises        concurs        hypothesizes   reports  
agrees         confirms       interprets     responds  
allows         criticizes     lists          reveals  
argues         declares       objects        states  
asserts        disagrees      observes       suggests  
believes       discusses      offers         thinks  
charges        disputes       opposes        writes  
</pre>

**Question:** Which signal verbs do you think are positive, negative, or neutral?

- Free and flexible
- Graded on completion
  
### Intro to Major Assignment 1: Summary-Response Essay (due 2/11)
   
#### Overview:
In the first Major Assignment, you will compose a summary-response essay. This type of essay is a critical academic exercise that allows you to engage deeply with a text, understand its main points and arguments, and respond to its ideas with your own analysis and perspective.

#### Purpose:
A summary-response essay serves several key academic purposes:
1. **Comprehension and Synthesis:** It tests your ability to understand and articulate the main ideas of a text. Summarizing requires you to distill complex ideas into concise, clear statements.
2. **Critical Thinking and Analysis:** This essay type challenges you to not only understand an author's viewpoint but also to analyze its strengths and weaknesses, and to respond with your own thoughts or critiques.
3. **Engagement with Texts:** It encourages active engagement with a text, moving beyond passive reading to active discussion.
4. **Development of Academic Voice:** Through your response, you can develop and express your own academic voice, backed by logical reasoning and evidence.

#### Structure:
Your essay should be divided into two main sections:
1. **Summary (Approximately one-third of the essay):**
   - Concisely summarize the main points and key arguments of the text.
   - Remain neutral and objective; this section is not for your opinions, but for presenting the author's ideas clearly.
2. **Response (Approximately two-thirds of the essay):**
   - Provide your analysis, critique, or reflection on the text's ideas.
   - You may agree, disagree, or both, but your response should be backed by evidence and reasoning.
   - Your response should engage with specific points from the summary, expanding on, contesting, or offering a new perspective on them.

#### Requirements:
- **Length:** The essay should be at least 400 words.
- **Text Selection:** Choose a text that is interesting to you. It should be substantial enough to provide material for both summary and response.
- **Originality:** Your response should reflect your own ideas and perspectives. Avoid plagiarism at all costs.
