### Schedule Announcement
- Drafting will start early this time: This Thursday (11/30) will be our drafting day instead of next Tuesday.  
- There will be TWO peer review sessions — 12/5 and 12/7 — and you can choose either one of them to attend.  
   
### End-of-Semester work
- Besides the final essay, there is another short reflection.
- Deadlines are not actually "dead." You can still submit everything until the very end of the semester.
  
### Course & Instructor Evaluation
- Please give the course feedback! It will help the entire English 101 teaching team.
- Please give me feedback! It will help me, this rookie teacher who needs a lot of feedback to improve.
  
### Today's Activity: A Debate!
An essay written by American columnist and reporter Michael Hiltzik published in *LA Times* in 2016 argued against the idea that video is a superior form of media consumption compared to text:  
- [Don’t believe Facebook: The demise of the written word is very far off](https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-written-word-demise-20160617-snap-story.html)
  
Unsurprisingly, this topic is still very, if not more, relevant today.  
  
#### Debate Activity: "The Future of Communication: Text vs. Video"
Will the written word remain a dominant form of communication, or will video take over?
  
##### Objective:
You will engage in a structured debate to explore and articulate complex arguments regarding the future dominance of text or video in communication, as discussed in Michael Hiltzik's article.
  
##### Activity Breakdown:
  
**1. Preparation**
- **Reading:** Take 10 minute to read Michael Hiltzik's article and get familiar with the context.
- **Divide the Class:** The class will split into two groups. One group will argue for the continued dominance of the written word, and the other will argue for the increasing dominance of video.
- **Preparation Time:** Each group will have 10 minutes to prepare their arguments. You are encouraged to use specific points from the article and to think about counterarguments to the opposing side's potential points.
  
**2. Opening Statements**
- Each group presents their opening statement, summarizing their position. Each group will have 2 minutes.
  
**3. Argument Rounds**
- **Round 1:** Each group takes turns presenting their main arguments. Each speaker have no more than 2 minutes. When one group speaks, the other group should take notes and think about how to counter-argue.
- **Round 2:** Rebuttal round. Groups respond to the arguments made by the opposing side. You are encouraged to address specific points and to use evidence from the article and external sources.
  
**4. Closing Statements**
- Each group has 2 minutes to make their final case, summarizing their key points and rebuttals.

### Understanding complexities in research studies: Could they be wrong?
#### Skim the following research report published in *Science* (linked below). Focus on the research methods of this study. How would you evaluate the findings of the study after knowing how the study was conducted? What are some complexities and nuances the researchers failed to account for?
[Cohn, Alain, et al. “Civic Honesty around the Globe.” *Science*, vol. 365, no. 6448, July 2019, pp. 70–73.](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.aau8712)  
  
Research Methods start from **the third column on the first page** "We visited 355 cities in 40 countries and turned in a total of 17,303 wallets..." and end on **the first column of the second page** "...can be found in the supplementary materials." Or you can read it below:  
> We visited 355 cities in 40 countries and turned in a total of 17,303 wallets. We typically targeted five to eight of the largest cities in a country, with roughly 400 observations per country. Wallets were turned in to one of five types of societal institutions: (i) banks; (ii) theaters, museums, or other cultural establishments; (iii) post offices; (iv) hotels; and (v) police stations, courts of law, or other public offices. These institutions serve as useful benchmarks because they are common across countries and typically have a public reception area where we could perform the drop-offs. Our wallets were transparent business card cases, which we used to ensure that recipients could visually inspect without having to physically open the wallet. Our key independent variable was whether the wallet contained money, which we randomly varied to hold either no money or US$13.45 (“NoMoney” and “Money” conditions, respectively). We used local currencies and, to ensure comparability across countries, adjusted the amount according to each country's purchasing power. Each wallet also contained three identical business cards, a grocery list, and a key. The business cards display the owner’s name and email address and we used fictitious but commonplace male names for each country. Both the grocery list and business cards were written in the country's local language to signal that the owner was a resident. After walking into the building, one of our research assistants (from a pool of 11 male and 2 female assistants) approached an employee at the counter and said, “Hi, I found this [pointing to the wallet] on the street around the corner.” The research assistant then placed the wallet on the counter and pushed it over to the employee, saying, “Somebody must have lost it. I’m in a hurry and have to go. Can you please take care of it?” The assistant then exited the building without leaving contact details or requesting written proof of having turned in the wallet. Our key outcome measure was whether recipients contacted the owner to return the wallet. We created a unique email address for each wallet and recorded emails that were sent within 100 days of the initial drop-off. Complete methods and results, including additional robustness checks such as testing for experimenter effects, can be found in the supplementary materials.

Try writing a counter-argument against this paper based on your evaluation of their research methods and their conclusion.

### Discussion questions after reading [*Generation Overshare*](https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2009-03-06/751524/) (*Final Draft* Page 108)  
1. How do you navigate the balance between online and offline interactions in your own life?  
2. In what ways has the internet changed how you perceive your own identity?  
3. How has the concept of community evolved with the advent of online social platforms?  
4. Do you agree with the idea that "transparency is the new privacy"? Why or why not?  
5. How might the evolution of digital interaction shape the societal norms of privacy and community in the future?  
  
Pick two questions to discuss within your group.
  
### Identify causes and effects
Identify the cause(s) and effect(s) in what you just discussed with your peers. Use the graph on *Final Draft* Page 105 to write them down.
  
### Practice using cause-effect expressions
Connect the causes and effects you just identified by putting them in complete sentences. Some expressions you can use include:  
- Due to
- Because of
- Owing to
- As a result of
- Consequently
- Therefore
- Thus
- Hence
- As a consequence
- Thereby
- Accordingly
- For this reason

Example:
- Cause: Rise of social media
- Effect: Decrease of attention span
- Sentence: The rise of social media **has led to** an increase of people's consumption of short-form, easy-to-digest content. **As a result of** this habit, our attention span has been decreasing.
  
## 10/19
### Common Fallacies in Reasoning

1.  **Scare tactics**
    - A strategy intended to manipulate public opinion
    about a particular issue by arousing fear or alarm.  
    - Example:
    "Goodyear. Because a lot is riding on your tires." \[Visual: a baby
    in a car seat. Outside the car it is raining and the car is slipping
    unsteadily.\]

3.  **Either/or choices (false dilemma)**
    - A conclusion that
    oversimplifies the argument by reducing it to only two sides or
    choices.  
    - (Examples: "We can either stop using cars or destroy the
    earth." "You're either for the war or against the troops.")

5.  **Slippery slope**
    - In a slippery slope argument, a course of
    action is rejected because, with little or no evidence, one insists
    that it will lead to a chain reaction resulting in an undesirable
    end.  
    - (Examples: "Universal background checks will inevitably be
    followed by a national registry of gun-owners which will inevitably
    be followed by confiscation of all their guns." "Today late for ten
    minutes, tomorrow late for an hour, and then someday you will simply
    cease to show up.")

7.  **Bandwagon appeals**
    - Urge people to follow the same path everyone
    else is taking.  
    - (Example: iPhone 5 Advertisement: "Loving it is
    easy. That's why so many people do.")

9.  **Ad hominem arguments** **(Latin for "to the man")**
     - Arguments
    attack the character of a person rather than the claims he or she
    makes.  
    - (Example: Student: "Hey, Professor Moore, we shouldn't have
    to read this book by Freud. Everyone knows he used cocaine.")

11.  **Hasty generalization**
     - An inference drawn from insufficient
    evidence  
    - (Example: "Because my Fiat broke down, all Fiats must be
    junk.")

13.  **Equivocations (doublespeak)**
     - When someone uses ambiguous
    language in order to support or refute an argument; when the
    conclusion of an argument depends on the fact that the word or
    phrase is used, either explicitly or implicitly, in two different
    senses in the argument.  
    - (Example: "Knowledge is power. Power
    corrupts. Study hard - be evil!")

15.  **Non sequitur (Latin for "it does not follow")**
     - When the
    conclusion does not follow from the premises.  
    - (Examples: "People
    generally like to walk on the beach. Beaches have sand. Therefore,
    having sand floors in homes would be a great idea!" "I got sick
    after eating sushi last week. Pizza is the best.")

17.  **Straw man**
     - When someone takes another person's argument or
    point, distorts it or exaggerates it in some kind of extreme way,
    and then attacks the extreme distortion as if that is really the
    claim the first person is making.  
    - (Example: After Will said that we
    should put more money into health and education, Warren responded by
    saying that he was surprised that Will hates our country so much
    that he wants to leave it defenseless by cutting military spending.)

19. **Red herring (misdirection)**
     - An abrupt change of subject or
    introduction of an irrelevant claim to throw readers off the trail.
    A deliberate diversion of attention with the intention of trying to
    abandon the original argument.  
    - (Examples: "The climate is always
    changing - it's natural." A: "It is morally wrong to cheat on your
    spouse, why on earth would you have done that?" B: "But what is
    morality exactly?")

### Comparison and contrast: Advanced level!
#### Compare and constrast two genres of writing
The following are two articles presenting the same study on smartphone addiction. The first article is published on the *Daily Mail UK*, a British tabloid. The second article is published in *Computers in Human Behavior*, an academic journal.
- Article on *Daily Mail*: [The countries with the highest rates of SMARTPHONE ADDICTION revealed - with China, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia topping the list](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-10498963/The-countries-highest-rates-SMARTPHONE-ADDICTION-revealed.html) *(The website will ask you for notification permission. Do not click "allow" if you don't intend to.)*  
- Article on *Computers in Human Behavior*: [Smartphone addiction is increasing across the world: A meta-analysis of 24 countries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563221004611)
  
##### Activity 1: Audience Perspective Role Play
- Step 1: Get into pairs. Student A will read the tabloid article and Student B will read the academic journal article.
- Step 2: You will summarize to each other your takeaways from the article you read. Compare your takeaways.
  
##### Activity 2: Analyze the Articles
- Step 1: In your same group, this time, Student B will read the tabloid article and Student A will read the academic journal article.
- Step 2: Now that you've all read both articles, discuss why you think you had different takeaways from these two articles (how different presentations can lead to varied understandings).
- Step 3: Suppose you are writing an essay and conpare and constrast these two articles, what would your thesis statement be? In your same group, come up with a thesis statement together.

### How to Cite Properly (MLA)
#### Example
**Original text:**  
"Feral cats roamed far more widely than researchers had expected: up to 1,351 acres. In contrast, pet cats stayed within an average of about five acres of home."  
  
**Author:** Madhumita Venkataramanan  
**Title of article:** "Where House Cats Roam"  
**Title of journal:** *Scientific American*  
**Year of publication:** 2011  
**Page number:** 30  

#### Citing as a Direct Quote
*In her article “Where House Cats Roam”, Madhumita Venkataramanan references a study that found that “pet cats stayed within an average of about five acres of home” (30).*  

#### Citing as a Paraphrase
*When pet cats go outdoors, they stay relatively close to home, whereas their feral counterparts sometimes roam over a thousand acres (Venkatraman 30).*  
 - (in APA the page number would be the publication year)

### Using Signal Phrases
**Definition:** Signal phrases are short phrases that introduce a quote, paraphrase, or summary; they signal to readers that an outside source is being used.  

#### Function of signal phrases: Avoid plagiarism and ambiguity

**Example**  
"In the personal realm, most Americans are thoughtful, caring, generous. We try to do our best by family and friends. At times we'll even stop to help another driver stranded with a roadside breakdown, or give some spare change to a stranger. [...] We've all but forgotten that public participation is the very soul of democratic citizenship, and how much it can enrich our lives." (excerpt from *Soul of a Citizen* by Paul Loeb)

**Paraphrase draft #1:**  
"Most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy. We tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good. We don't realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - What is the problem?  

**Paraphrase draft #2:**  
"According to Paul Loeb, most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy. We tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good. Paul Loeb thinks that we don't realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - Any problems still? (think in-text citation)  

**Paraphrase draft #3:**  
"According to Paul Loeb, most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy; we tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good (2). Although Loeb doesn't say so explicitly, he suggests that we fail to realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - Any problems still? (No it's perfect!!)  

#### Function of signal phrases: Establish credibility of the source authors

**Example:**  
"In Soul of a Citizen, **journalist and lecturer Paul Loeb** observes that most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but that few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy (2)."

#### Function of signal phrases: Capture the authors’ viewpoint

**Examples:**  
"In Soul of a Citizen, journalist and lecturer Paul Loeb **observes** that most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but that few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy (2)."  
 - accuracy
  
"In *Job Shift*, consultant William Bridges **worries about** “dejobbing and about what a future shaped by it is going to be like.” Even more worrisome, Bridges **argues**, is the possibility that “the sense of craft and of professional vocation . . . will break down under the need to earn a fee” (228)."  
 - a sense of urgency   
  
"In *Job Shift*, William Bridges **unreasonably contends / fantasizes** that “the sense of craft and of professional vocation . . . will break down under the need to earn a fee” (228)."  
 - we don't agree with the author  

#### Some Frequently Used Signal Verbs

admits         concludes      expresses      replies
