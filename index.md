### Intro to 2nd Essay: Compare and Contrast
A comparison and contrast essay examines two or more subjects by comparing their similarities and contrasting their differences. This type of essay typically structures information either by subject (discussing all aspects of one subject before moving to the next) or by point (alternating between subjects for each point of comparison or contrast). Its purpose is to analyze the subjects in relation to each other to highlight how they are alike or distinct, often to make a larger point about the subjects' characteristics or implications.  

### Compare and Contrast Discussion
#### Discussion topic: "Talent" in different cultures
1. **Nature of Talent**: How do your culture's beliefs about whether talent is innate or developed compare with what you've observed or heard about other cultures? 
2. **Importance of Talent vs. Effort**: In your home country, which is more valued in professions like arts, academics, or sports: natural talent or hard work? How does this stand in contrast to other countries or cultures you're aware of?
3. **Recognition and Rewards**: Compare the ways societies reward natural talent versus perseverance. Is there a difference between your home culture and others in terms of which is rewarded more?
4. **Education and Talent**: In the education system you grew up in, how are "talented" students treated compared to those in other countries or cultures you're familiar with? Are there unique programs or systems in place?
5. **Pressure and Expectations**: Compare the pressures of being labeled as "talented" in your home country to what you perceive those pressures to be in other cultures or countries.
6. **Overlooked Abilities**: Are there certain skills or abilities that are more valued in your culture compared to others? Conversely, are there talents that you feel are undervalued in your culture but celebrated elsewhere?
7. **Role of Opportunity**: How do opportunities and resources available for nurturing talent in your home country compare to another country or culture you're familiar with?
8. **Cultural Narratives**: Think of cultural heroes from your country celebrated for their talents. How do their stories of innate ability or perseverance compare with similar figures from another culture?
9. **Talent in the Workplace**: Compare how employers in your country prioritize talent versus experience or qualifications with what you know of practices in other countries.
10. **Talent in Changing Times**: How do you think the importance placed on certain talents in your home country compares to another when considering technological and societal changes?

### Crafting Your Response

#### Objective:
Today's class is dedicated to developing the response portion of your summary-response essay. Through the activities and discussions, you'll refine your ability to articulate a compelling, evidence-backed viewpoint on your chosen article.

#### Agenda:

**Warm-Up: Quick Reflection**
   - Write down one key argument from your article that you strongly agree or disagree with. Think about why this argument stood out to you.

**Group Discussion: Sharing Insights**
   - Form small groups and share the argument you chose during the warm-up. Discuss your initial thoughts on agreeing or disagreeing with the author's viewpoint.

**Introduction to Response Strategies**

>##### Strategy 1: Agreeing with a Twist
>- **Description:** You agree with the article’s points but introduce a new angle or insight that wasn't covered.
>- **Approach:** Start by acknowledging the points you agree with, then introduce your unique perspective or additional evidence that builds on the original argument.
>
>##### Strategy 2: Disagreeing with Reasons
>- **Description:** You challenge the article’s arguments, offering evidence or reasoning to support your disagreement.
>- **Approach:** Clearly state which points you disagree with and why. Use evidence from the article, other sources, or personal experience to back up your counter-argument.
>
>##### Strategy 3: Reflecting on Personal Experience
>- **Description:** You connect the article’s themes or arguments to your own experiences, adding depth and personal insight.
>- **Approach:** Share a personal story or reflection that relates to the article. Explain how your experience supports, contradicts, or sheds new light on the article's points.
>
>##### Strategy 4: Analyzing the Implications
>- **Description:** You explore the broader implications or consequences of the article’s arguments.
>- **Approach:** Discuss the potential impact of the article’s ideas on society, a particular group, or the future. Consider both positive and negative outcomes.
>
>##### Tips for Writing Your Response:
>1. **Be Specific:** Focus on particular points or arguments from the article. Avoid generalizations.
>2. **Use Evidence:** Support your response with evidence, whether from the article, external sources, or personal experience.
>3. **Stay Objective:** While personal opinions are valuable, ensure your response is grounded in logical reasoning and evidence.
>4. **Employ Signal Verbs:** Use verbs that accurately reflect the author’s stance (e.g., argues, claims, suggests) and verbs that articulate your response (e.g., contend, oppose, affirm).
>5. **Maintain Clarity:** Be clear and concise in your writing. Ensure your reader understands the article's points you're responding to and your stance on them.
  
**Activity: Strategy Application**
   - In your groups, select one strategy from the handout to focus on. Using this strategy, brainstorm potential responses to the argument discussed earlier. Consider how different perspectives or new evidence could enrich your response.

**Debate: Exploring Multiple Sides**
   - Each group presents their response ideas to the class, initiating a mini-debate. Encourage respectful challenge and support for the ideas presented, exploring the argument from multiple angles.

### How to Cite Properly (MLA)
#### Example
**Original text:**  
"Feral cats roamed far more widely than researchers had expected: up to 1,351 acres. In contrast, pet cats stayed within an average of about five acres of home."  
  
**Author:** Madhumita Venkataramanan  
**Title of article:** "Where House Cats Roam"  
**Title of journal:** *Scientific American*  
**Year of publication:** 2011  
**Page number:** 30  

#### Citing as a Direct Quote
*In her article “Where House Cats Roam”, Madhumita Venkataramanan references a study that found that “pet cats stayed within an average of about five acres of home” (30).*  

#### Citing as a Paraphrase
*When pet cats go outdoors, they stay relatively close to home, whereas their feral counterparts sometimes roam over a thousand acres (Venkatraman 30).*  
 - (in APA the page number would be the publication year)

### Using Signal Phrases
**Definition:** Signal phrases are short phrases that introduce a quote, paraphrase, or summary; they signal to readers that an outside source is being used.  

#### Function of signal phrases: Avoid plagiarism and ambiguity

**Example**  
"In the personal realm, most Americans are thoughtful, caring, generous. We try to do our best by family and friends. At times we'll even stop to help another driver stranded with a roadside breakdown, or give some spare change to a stranger. [...] We've all but forgotten that public participation is the very soul of democratic citizenship, and how much it can enrich our lives." (excerpt from *Soul of a Citizen* by Paul Loeb)

**Paraphrase draft #1:**  
"Most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy. We tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good. We don't realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - What is the problem?  

**Paraphrase draft #2:**  
"According to Paul Loeb, most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy. We tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good. Paul Loeb thinks that we don't realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - Any problems still? (think in-text citation)  

**Paraphrase draft #3:**  
"According to Paul Loeb, most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy; we tend to isolate ourselves from others and focus on our private lives instead of the public good (2). Although Loeb doesn't say so explicitly, he suggests that we fail to realize that helping others helps ourselves."  
 - Any problems still? (No it's perfect!!)  

#### Function of signal phrases: Establish credibility of the source authors

**Example:**  
"In Soul of a Citizen, **journalist and lecturer Paul Loeb** observes that most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but that few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy (2)."

#### Function of signal phrases: Capture the authors’ viewpoint

**Examples:**  
"In Soul of a Citizen, journalist and lecturer Paul Loeb **observes** that most Americans are generous and kind on an individual, interpersonal level but that few recognize how important civic, social, and public engagement is to our democracy (2)."  
 - accuracy
  
"In *Job Shift*, consultant William Bridges **worries about** “dejobbing and about what a future shaped by it is going to be like.” Even more worrisome, Bridges **argues**, is the possibility that “the sense of craft and of professional vocation . . . will break down under the need to earn a fee” (228)."  
 - a sense of urgency   
  
"In *Job Shift*, William Bridges **unreasonably contends / fantasizes** that “the sense of craft and of professional vocation . . . will break down under the need to earn a fee” (228)."  
 - we don't agree with the author  

#### Some Frequently Used Signal Verbs

<pre>
acknowledges   claims         emphasizes     remarks  
admits         concludes      expresses      replies  
advises        concurs        hypothesizes   reports  
agrees         confirms       interprets     responds  
allows         criticizes     lists          reveals  
argues         declares       objects        states  
asserts        disagrees      observes       suggests  
believes       discusses      offers         thinks  
charges        disputes       opposes        writes  
</pre>

**Question:** Which signal verbs do you think are positive, negative, or neutral?

### Evaluating the Credibility of Sources

#### 1. Compare the following two sources. Which do you think is a more reliable source? Why?
**American Academy of Pediatrics** [(Link)](https://www.aap.org/) vs. **American College of Pediatricians** [(Link)](https://acpeds.org/)  
- Compare their names, the design of their websites, the content on their websites.  
- Do a search of them. Compare the results of the searches.

#### 2. In groups, find at least **two sources** that you could use for a paper on the following topic:  
- The effects of veganism on the environment  
1. Two minutes to find sources.  
2. Three minutes to discuss and evaluate the sources as a group. (Don't forget to do external searches.)  
3. Report to the class your evaluation of the sources: How did you evaluate them? Are they reliable? Why?

### Selecting and Evaluating Articles for Summary-Response Essay

#### 1. Understanding the Criteria
- Your chosen article should be:
  - **Engaging:** It should capture your interest.
  - **Thought-Provoking:** It should present ideas or *arguments* that stimulate your thinking.

### Intro to Major Assignment 1: Summary-Response Essay (due 2/11)
   
#### Overview:
In the first Major Assignment, you will compose a summary-response essay. This type of essay is a critical academic exercise that allows you to engage deeply with a text, understand its main points and arguments, and respond to its ideas with your own analysis and perspective.

#### Purpose:
A summary-response essay serves several key academic purposes:
1. **Comprehension and Synthesis:** It tests your ability to understand and articulate the main ideas of a text. Summarizing requires you to distill complex ideas into concise, clear statements.
2. **Critical Thinking and Analysis:** This essay type challenges you to not only understand an author's viewpoint but also to analyze its strengths and weaknesses, and to respond with your own thoughts or critiques.
3. **Engagement with Texts:** It encourages active engagement with a text, moving beyond passive reading to active discussion.
4. **Development of Academic Voice:** Through your response, you can develop and express your own academic voice, backed by logical reasoning and evidence.

#### Structure:
Your essay should be divided into two main sections:
1. **Summary (Approximately one-third of the essay):**
   - Concisely summarize the main points and key arguments of the text.
   - Remain neutral and objective; this section is not for your opinions, but for presenting the author's ideas clearly.
2. **Response (Approximately two-thirds of the essay):**
   - Provide your analysis, critique, or reflection on the text's ideas.
   - You may agree, disagree, or both, but your response should be backed by evidence and reasoning.
   - Your response should engage with specific points from the summary, expanding on, contesting, or offering a new perspective on them.

#### Requirements:
- **Length:** The essay should be at least 400 words.
- **Text Selection:** Choose a text that is interesting to you. It should be substantial enough to provide material for both summary and response.
- **Originality:** Your response should reflect your own ideas and perspectives. Avoid plagiarism at all costs.
