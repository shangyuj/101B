### Intro to Major Assignment 1: Summary-Response Essay (due 2/11)
   
#### Overview:
In the first Major Assignment, you will compose a summary-response essay. This type of essay is a critical academic exercise that allows you to engage deeply with a text, understand its main points and arguments, and respond to its ideas with your own analysis and perspective.

#### Purpose:
A summary-response essay serves several key academic purposes:
1. **Comprehension and Synthesis:** It tests your ability to understand and articulate the main ideas of a text. Summarizing requires you to distill complex ideas into concise, clear statements.
2. **Critical Thinking and Analysis:** This essay type challenges you to not only understand an author's viewpoint but also to analyze its strengths and weaknesses, and to respond with your own thoughts or critiques.
3. **Engagement with Texts:** It encourages active engagement with a text, moving beyond passive reading to active discussion.
4. **Development of Academic Voice:** Through your response, you can develop and express your own academic voice, backed by logical reasoning and evidence.

#### Structure:
Your essay should be divided into two main sections:
1. **Summary (Approximately one-third of the essay):**
   - Concisely summarize the main points and key arguments of the text.
   - Remain neutral and objective; this section is not for your opinions, but for presenting the author's ideas clearly.
2. **Response (Approximately two-thirds of the essay):**
   - Provide your analysis, critique, or reflection on the text's ideas.
   - You may agree, disagree, or both, but your response should be backed by evidence and reasoning.
   - Your response should engage with specific points from the summary, expanding on, contesting, or offering a new perspective on them.

#### Requirements:
- **Length:** The essay should be at least 400 words.
- **Text Selection:** Choose a text that is interesting to you. It should be substantial enough to provide material for both summary and response.
- **Originality:** Your response should reflect your own ideas and perspectives. Avoid plagiarism at all costs.

   - **Specificity:** Emphasize the importance of narrowing down a topic to make it more manageable and focused.
   - **Originality:** Explain how bringing a unique perspective or angle to a topic can enhance writing.
   - **Scope:** Discuss how to balance the breadth and depth of a topic to ensure it's neither too broad nor too narrow.
   - **Personal Interest:** Highlight why personal connection or passion for a topic can motivate deeper research and more engaging writing.
